The study aimed to understand the peculiar seismic behavior of hill buildings due to their irregular and unsymmetrical structural configurations on hill slopes. The findings of the analytical study were corroborated by observations during damage surveys after the Sikkim earthquake."}, {"role": "user", "content": "hi"}, {"role": "bot", "content": "Hello!

The optimal placement of these active bars is crucial for the structural design phase, shape, and vibration control. By strategically placing these active bars and using feedback control systems, the structure can actively counteract vibrations, leading to improved performance and safety."}, {"role": "user", "content": "author of Strain monitoring of railway bridges using optic fiber sensors"}, {"role": "bot", "content": "The authors of \"Strain monitoring of railway bridges using optic fiber sensors\" are Gao Zhan-feng, Du Yan-liang, Sun Bao-chen, and Jin Xiu-mei."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who is SC MOHAN"}, {"role": "bot", "content": "S.C.
