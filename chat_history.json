The study aimed to understand the peculiar seismic behavior of hill buildings due to their irregular and unsymmetrical structural configurations on hill slopes. The findings of the analytical study were corroborated by observations during damage surveys after the Sikkim earthquake."}, {"role": "user", "content": "hi"}, {"role": "bot", "content": "Hello!
